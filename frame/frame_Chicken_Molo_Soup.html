       	 Chicken Molo Soup, also known as Pancit Molo, originates from the Molo district of Iloilo City in the 
        Philippines. The dish is an adaptation of Chinese wonton soup, introduced by early Chinese immigrants
        in the area before Spanish colonization. Over time, it was localized with Filipino flavors and 
        ingredients, becoming a celebrated comfort food. The name "Pancit Molo" reflects the inclusion 
        of dumpling wrappers, often associated with noodle dishes in Filipino culinary terminologyâ€‹.
