       Humba is a savory Visayan dish, particularly popular in Cebu, that is known for its rich, tender, and flavorful pork. This dish is often made with pork belly or hocks, 
	braised in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, garlic, onions, and bay leaves. The key to humba's unique flavor is the balance between the sweet and salty notes, 
	often enhanced with the addition of pineapple or banana blossoms. Humba is cooked slowly, allowing the pork to absorb the delicious sauce and become incredibly tender.
 	The dish is typically served with steamed rice, making it a hearty and satisfying meal. The preparation of humba is a labor of love, as it requires patience to let 
	the flavors meld and develop over time. It has roots in Spanish colonial influences, which can be seen in the combination of soy sauce and vinegar. Humba is often
	 prepared during special occasions or family gatherings, as it is considered a celebratory dish. While humba is enjoyed across the Visayas, each region and family 
	has its own variation, with some using different meats or seasonings to suit local tastes. As a symbol of Visayan home-cooked comfort food, humba remains a favorite 
	that brings people together over hearty, flavorful meals.
