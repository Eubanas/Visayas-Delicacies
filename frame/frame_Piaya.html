      Piaya is a beloved traditional delicacy from the Visayas, particularly popular in Negros Occidental. This sweet, flatbread-like treat is typically made from flour,
 sugar, and sesame seeds, filled with a molasses or muscovado sugar syrup. The dough is rolled thin and cooked on a griddle until golden brown, often slightly crispy
 on the outside. Piaya has its roots in the Visayan region, with its name derived from the Hiligaynon word "piaya," meaning "sweet and filled." It is commonly enjoyed 
as a snack or dessert, often paired with coffee or as a pasalubong (souvenir) to bring home. The use of muscovado sugar, derived from sugarcane, gives piaya its distinct
, rich flavor. While traditionally made with the sweet filling, there are now various flavors of piaya, including ube, chocolate, and pandan. The process of making piay
a involves rolling the dough thinly and then folding it over the filling before cooking it on a flat, heated surface. Piaya has become a popular product for tourists
 visiting the Visayan region, and it can be found in specialty shops and local markets. Over the years, piaya has maintained its popularity and continues to be a
 delicious symbol of Visayan craftsmanship in the culinary world.
