         La Paz Batchoy is one of Iloilo's best-known signature dishes and a must-try delicacy served in 
        restaurants all over Iloilo City. This noodle soup is made with miki, (round noodles), pork organs
        (liver, spleen, kidneys, and heart), chicken stock, beef loin, shrimp stock, and garnished with
        chicharon (pork cracklings). It is best eaten at the batchoyan (batchoy stalls) in La Paz Market where
        it originated. The most famous places to eat batchoy are Ted's, Deco's, Netong's, and Inggo's. 
        The “original” creator of the dish is not certain, but you may judge for yourself which among them 
        serves the tastiest. When served with a bowl of batchoy, most Ilonggos would finish the kaldo (broth) 
        first. It is customary to request additional refills of kaldo before finishing the meal.
