        The "chicken inasal" is a local version of the Filipino barbecue that originated from Bacolod City
        in the Visayas islands south of the Philippines. It is a delicious dish of chicken parts marinated
        in local herbs and spices, skewered on bamboo sticks then grilled to juicy perfection. Chicken inasal
        is so popular in Bacolod City that there are street stands selling the chicken barbecue in almost every
        corner. Bacolod City and the surrounding region is well known for its delicious cuisine that are popular
        favorites of most Filipinos.
