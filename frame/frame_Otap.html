     	Otap is a crisp, flaky pastry from Cebu, often enjoyed as a snack or dessert. Made from a dough that’s layered with sugar and shortening, the pastry has a distinct
 	texture—crispy and light, with a slight chewiness on the inside. Otap is baked until golden brown, with the sugar caramelizing slightly on the surface to add sweetness.
 	The origins of this pastry can be traced back to Cebu, where it’s a beloved treat both for locals and tourists alike. Often enjoyed with coffee or tea, Otap’s simple
 	yet satisfying flavors make it a perfect snack for any time of the day. While traditional Otap is made with just sugar, variations can include ube (purple yam) 
	or mango flavors, providing a different twist on the classic. The pastry is also a popular pasalubong (souvenir) for tourists visiting Cebu, thanks to its light
 	texture and sweet taste. In addition to its delightful flavor, Otap's flaky layers are a testament to the skilled baking techniques passed down through generations.
 	It’s a true reflection of Cebu’s rich culinary heritage, offering a taste of the region’s love for simple yet delicious treats. Whether for gifting or enjoying on your
	 own, Otap remains an iconic part of Cebu's snack culture.
