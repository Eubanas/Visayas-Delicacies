       Binakol is a comforting chicken soup from the Visayas, most commonly associated with the provinces of Panay and Negros.
	This dish stands out due to its unique use of coconut water, which adds a natural sweetness to the broth. The chicken is simmered with lemongrass, ginger, and sometimes
	 turmeric, creating a fragrant and mildly spiced base. One of the signature features of Binakol is its use of coconut meat, which is incorporated into the soup, adding
	 both texture and a rich flavor. It is often served in a coconut shell, making it even more authentic and visually appealing. The dish is filled with vegetables like 
	string beans, green papaya, and sometimes saba bananas, adding depth and a natural sweetness to the overall flavor. The delicate combination of coconut, lemongrass,
 	and chicken creates a light yet savory broth that is perfect for any meal. Many also add chili for a little heat, balancing the natural sweetness of the coconut. 
	Traditionally, Binakol is a comfort food served during gatherings or rainy days, and it pairs perfectly with hot rice. Its warmth and wholesome ingredients make it
 	a staple in Visayan cuisine.
