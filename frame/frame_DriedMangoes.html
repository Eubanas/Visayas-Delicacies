      	Dried mangoes from the Visayas, particularly from Cebu, are world-famous for their sweetness and quality. These mangoes are carefully selected and ripened to perfection
 	before being peeled, sliced, and sun-dried. The drying process intensifies the natural sweetness of the fruit, giving the dried slices a chewy texture and rich,
 	caramelized flavor. The mangoes used are typically the Carabao variety, known for their smooth and buttery flesh. These dried mangoes have become a popular snack both
 	locally and internationally, often packaged as gifts or souvenirs. The popularity of dried mangoes has made them a key export for the Philippines, with many visitors
	 buying them to take home as a taste of the country. Dried mangoes are often enjoyed on their own, but they can also be used as a topping for desserts or incorporated 
	into baked goods. Many people enjoy them with a refreshing drink, as they provide a burst of natural fruit flavor. Their compact size and portability make them an ideal
	 snack for on-the-go or a healthy alternative to candy. The distinct sweetness and quality of dried mangoes make them a true representation of the Visayan agricultural
	 bounty.
